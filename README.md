# My Python Projects from DataQuest's Online Course: Data Scientist in Python:

# 1. Prison Escapes by Helicopter - location: 'Prison' folder
# 2. Application Recommendation System - location: 'Recommendations' folder
# 3. Exploring Hacker News Posts - location: 'HackerNews' folder

All these projects were done in `Jupyter Notebook` and track my progress as an data analyst/scientists with Python, 
the projects were coded over a span of 3 days.

# Project Details & Introductions: 
Note: All the code is explained in detail in the Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb).

# First Project - Data Analysis on Prison Escapes by Helicopter:
This project uses data from a Wikipedia article containing a table on prison escapes by helecopter.
It uses Python to analyse the dataset to figure out:
1. In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?
2. In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison breaks occur?

# Second Project - Application Recommendation System: 
This project uses data from two 'csv-file' datasets on all the applications on Apple Store and Google Play Store
to recommend the best-performing mobile applications for a made-up company to develop with the highest chance of success on 
both Apple and Android devices.
The Jupyter file 'Basics.ipynb' contains analysed data with both Python and text descriptions.

# Third Project - Exploring Hacker News Posts:
This project uses data from a 'csv-file' dataset of submissions to the popular technology site "Hacker News" to find posts
titled with 'Ask HN' and 'Show Hn' and calculates their popularity, best time to post, average comments and more.

# To be continued:
I will be posting more projects to this folder as i progress through the course.
